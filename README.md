# TourismManagementSystem
Tourism Management System is an integrated software developed for tourism business. It is a dynamic and responsive system. This system connects customers and agents directly, provides a feedback mechanism for tourists, maintains and controls the database of touristsâ€™ information, and gives a variety of travel services.
<b>Features of the proposed system</b>
<b>Security</b>: The system is entirely password protected. Only authorized users can get access.
<b>Flexibility</b>: The project has been designed in such a way that new features and modules can be added to the system in the future as per user requirements.
<b>Time-Saving</b>: One can access the travel management office from anywhere on the web and need not visit the travel agency office.
